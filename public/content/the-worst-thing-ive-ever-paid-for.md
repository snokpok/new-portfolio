With the forever increasing popularity regarding becoming a software engineer/developer, getting $100k a year and living the good life, people have been searching for ways to break into the tech industry. As consumers of the 21st century we love products that are both cheap (dirtcheap if possible) and of great quality (Louis Vuitton and Gucci-like). We thus try to solve this optimization problem: given resources e.g money/assets as an input of amount `x`, we need to maximize the value we extract from it per dollar `y`. Everyone knows the traditional way to get into software engineering or related technical roles: get a CS degree + some technical experience through internships or personal projects, and then apply to these great tech companies. But the value of the CS degree is said to be limited and that the CS degree also consumes too much time for the limited value it provides. In particular, people often bring up how most of the things we CS students learn will never really apply to our daily job or that very little of what we learned would be applicable.

As a computer science major at a great university, I could partly agree to this. Generally, you have to take a certain amount of general education courses, and often it's something you aren't interested about. Courses that satisfy your major requirements are not exempt from this fact either--I have to take an electrical engineering class but I'm not an EE/CECS major, and I'm not necessarily going into embedded systems in my job either. For the courses that are just pure computer science, some of them cover things like proofs and algorithms that I probably will never use in my job. Why then am I learning how to be a purist **computer scientist instead of a software engineer?** ... Oh wait.

## What is computer science?

At this point of our rant, we realize that the _computer science major_ is **not explicitly** about creating softwares or being a software developer/engineer. Computer science is a broad field with the goal of understanding computation, automation, and information (ripped this from the first line of the Wikipedia). Learning computer science is not just about learning how to build softwares, but rather it's about learning these things that constitutes computers. By having a technical and detailed knowledge of the concepts of computer science, a CS student is equipped with not only skills to understand computers but also various hard skills e.g problem-solving and creative thinking skills that is necessary to solve problems related to computers and various other problems in computer science. The CS degree thus provides you the **skills, frameworks and knowledge** regarding computer science, which is important if you want to pursue a career in software engineering/development.

This is why the majority of SWEs in this world has a CS degree, because it provides the set of knowledge and skills that allows us to not only build softwares in scalable and efficient ways but also to understand problems when we need to debug production errors.

## Engineer vs developer

A common misconception within interested communities is to treat these twos as the same role while they're not. Sure, engineers are developers since what we do day-in and day-out concerns developing softwares, but there's a difference that we can spot by just looking into the definition of the word _engineer_, that is: we also fix things to make it run quicker than ever before, and we are also conscious about the different pros and cons of what we've built, which consists of knowing the worst-case circumstances that can wreck the entire ship and sink it like when Jack bids farewell to Rose as the Titanic dives itself into the abyss of the ocean. In the same way construction companies hire civil engineers to make sure buildings are reliably stable and can withstand earthquakes, tech companies hire SWEs to be not only 99.9% sure that their products run smoothly and quickly, but also to be relatively sure it won't crash during high-traffic circumstances, and also even if it does crash, we can reboot things quickly and operations resume to normal in little time.

## Q: Don't coding bootcamps also teach these skills?

Some do, some don't. For those that do, they often teach it very well--to the point their content covers all if not more than what's covered in 4 years of computer science. In that case, the 4-year CS degree does indeed fall short to this <1 year coding bootcamp certification. But I believe there's much more to being a CS student than the degree.

### The value of college

When you go to college, you shouldn't be paying only for that degree that you complete after 4 years of busting your ass off in exams, homeworks and quizzes. If you do then you're really **really** missing out, because after all the degree is just a piece of paper with your name on it--rethinking what it is reveals that the value of this piece of paper is dependent not only the various skills you've gained as a student throughout your classes but also the value that you got outside of them. Student organizations and events are really only available to students, and it's a great way to get experience in various areas before you set your foot in the tech industry. As the engineering VP at <a href="https://hacksc.org">HackSC</a>, I was able to create an engineering culture that almost resembles a tech startup: we build a good number of tech/web platforms and tools used by both us--the organizers--and the hackers participating in our annual hackathon. The engineering team head count is 10+ and managing this amount of engineers require me to establish a great engineering culture/environment in order for us to succeed as a student org. Among our practices concerns using task management systems to keep track of our work, writing proper documentations whenever features are built, creating and maintaing development / code conventions, and employing proper and effective Git development workflows. As such, all of our engineers are basically getting experience working in a real technical environment similar to that in a real tech company. This sort of experience is hard to get if you're not a student and you're trying to get some experience before that first internship you want to get this summer.

## The bottom line

I may miss a couple of points because after all I only know up to what I have researched about coding bootcamps. Nonetheless, even if there's a coding bootcamp experience that is better than that of a 4-years college, I still believe that being in college pursuing a computer science degree provides much more value to me as a prospective software engineer than if I have pursued alternative options.

That's it for this post! I hope you enjoyed the read. Any comments or ideas please drop them below, and stay tuned for my next entry. Chao!
